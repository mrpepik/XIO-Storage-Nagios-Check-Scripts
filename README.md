# XIO-Storage-Nagios-Check-Scripts

A project I was involved in required the monitoring of XIO storage systems.  

Based on research, there might be a windows utility to monitor these systems, but I was not able to find this product. Additionally, with Nagios running on Linux, that utility made no sense.  

I was able to locate and download the XIOTECH-STORAGE2-MIB.txt file. Using this MIB, I verified that one it was the correct MIB file for the XIO systems and two that I was able to locate the friendly names for all of the queries.

I have include the MIB file in this repo.

The scripts do have help functions and are freely available to download and modify.
